Consequences of Global Warming
Rising Sea Levels

Melting glaciers and ice sheets are causing sea levels to rise, threatening coastal communities and ecosystems.
Extreme Weather Events

Climate change is increasing the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events like heatwaves, droughts, floods, and hurricanes.
Biodiversity Loss

Many species are struggling to adapt to the rapid changes in their habitats, leading to a decline in biodiversity.

Disrupted Food Supplies

Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns are affecting agricultural productivity and food security.
